# Welcome to rust-wasmpack-loader

**rust-wasmpack-loader** is a powerful Webpack and Bun loader that enables seamless integration of Rust resources into
your JavaScript/TypeScript projects through WebAssembly (WASM).

## What is rust-wasmpack-loader?

rust-wasmpack-loader is a native WASM loader for `.rs` (Rust) resources that works with:

- [**Webpack**](https://webpack.js.org/) `^5.0.0` (Both `web` and `node` (`node-async`) targets)
- [**Bun**](https://bun.sh/) runtime (node target only)

## Key Features

🚀 **Easy Integration** — Import `.rs` files directly in your `.js` or `.ts` files without any headache

🔧 **Flexible Configuration** — Supports both `wasm_bindgen` and regular functions

📦 **Smart Discovery** — Dynamically finds the `Cargo.toml` file for building the WASM source

🌐 **Multi-Target Webpack Support** — Works with `web` and `node` applications

⚡ **Bun Compatible** — Full support for Bun runtime (node target only for now)

## Why Use rust-wasmpack-loader?

- **Simplicity**: The most obvious one — No complex build setups, import and use
- **Write computation-heavy code in Rust**: Leverage Rust's performance for CPU-intensive tasks
- **Ecosystem**: Access the rich Rust ecosystem from your any projects

## Quick Example

```javascript
// Import Rust code directly
import wasmModule from './fibonacci.rs';

// Use the compiled WASM module
const result = wasmModule.fibonacci(10);
console.log(result); // Output: 55
```

```rust
// fibonacci.rs
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
    }
}
```
